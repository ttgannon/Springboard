- What is HTTP?
hypertext transfer protocol: the set of instructions your browser reads to 
display webpages from a server and communicate with the server.

- What is a URL?
uniform resource locator: it is an address that is shorthand for an IP address which all webpages have.

- What is DNS?
domain name service: it stores the names humans use for webpages and compares them to IP 
addresses. 

- What is a query string?
it is at the end of a URL taking key value pairs to specify search queries


- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET and POST: get is a verb where your device retrieves information from the webpage or the server.
POST is when your device is sending information from your computer to the server and the webpage. 

- What is an HTTP request?
when you use your device to access a webpage, you request from a server that runs that webpage; you make an 
HTTP request.


- What is an HTTP response?
the server will respond with the information to the computer that makes a request. 


- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
headers are in the response and provide information about the request or the response; examples include
host, cache-control, last-modified, and content-type


- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
your browser first finds the IP address in the DNS; then, it requests the webpage at that IP address. The 
server at that address sends a response and the information is read from the server and displayed on your 
computer screen.
