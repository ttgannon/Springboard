var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

instead:

const PI = 3.14;
//prevents reassignment

const myName = Gavin;
function write(something) {
    console.log(something);
}

write(myName);


What is the difference between var and let?
    Var is older from pre-ES2015 era. It exists as a variable on the window object and is available globally. It can be both
    redeclared and reassigned, which can be confusing. Variables are also hoisted. 

What is the difference between var and const?
    Const is the same as let (which was described above), except primitive data types declared with 
    const cannot be reassigned, while those declared using let (and of course, var) can. 

What is the difference between let and const?
    By the transitive property, I have already answered this question. 

what is hoisting?
    Hoisting happens with variables declared using var: those declarations are compiled first, giving the browser an awareness
    of the variable in question, even if it is not yet defined in the codebase. It would return undefined instead of generating an error.
